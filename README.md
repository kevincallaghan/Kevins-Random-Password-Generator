## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

To learn how to validate my variable inputs for character type, I found a question on Stack Overflow that was very similar to the question I had regarding validation, and in the answers I found logic that was able to solve the problem I was having with requiring only Y or N inputs, and requiring at least one Y input.  The question/answer can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48410637/can-i-use-a-while-loop-to-validate-a-prompt-input
